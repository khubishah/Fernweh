Fernweh is German for "craving for travel", or a "homesickness for distant, unvisited places" ( so really just a more original way of saying wanderlust ;) ). This web application prototype is my first attempt at using Node/Express/MongoDB/Mongoose
to create my own complex RESTful API along with client-side code. The purpose of this application is to let users view various tours around the world, create their own account, book them, pay for them, and write ratings for them.

Cool features:
